## Jade Alvares

I am a passion and driven person and have always been interested in how things work.  This led me to pursue a degree and masters in biological sciences as I was fascinated by why and how the body functioned.  I was always the person asking a lot of questions and this didn't change when I worked in IT & Telecoms, where I became very interested in how the applications were made and how they worked. My interest in the technology industry and building products flourished throughout my time there and I was certain that this was what I wanted to do.   

When I have completed Makers Academy, I would love to use my newly found skills to explore and build innovative products and applications, as well constantly evolving and learning as a programmer by challenging me to resolve new issues.

## Skills

#### Learning

Whether it has been in an academic sense or learning a new activity I have always enjoyed increasing my knowledge and skills. In my role as a brand ambassador I would research and study the material I was given and have to know everything about the product or service I was promoting in a short space of time.  

#### Working in a team

I enjoy working towards goals with a group of people.  Outside of academia, I was a member of an Irish dancing academy where we regularly traveled the country to compete against other dance groups and were fortunate enough to dance in the Royal Albert hall and London Palladium.
One of the reasons I decided to learn code from Makers Academy was because I thought I would really enjoy the pair programming aspect of learning.

#### Inquisitive

I am constantly asking questions and passionate in understanding every detail in a certain situation, whether that be how the body copes at high altitudes; such as in my thesis project, or why a particular piece of code works or not.

#### Time-keeping

During my time at Broadsoft I had to visit many partner offices to help in deployment of our product and training the vendors and sales people. My team was cut in half a few months into this project and I was soon faced with many more partners and very little time to travel around them all.

I therefore had to be very efficient with my time to make sure no one was neglected and everyone felt supported by doing many workshops remotely and dedicating specific time in the week to have question and answer sessions with all the partners.
