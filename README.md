I am a Full-Stack Junior Developer currently working in the Natural History Museum.  I have always been interested in how things work and this led me to pursue a degree and masters in biological sciences as I was fascinated by why and how the body functioned.  I was always the person asking a lot of questions and this didn't change when I worked in IT & Telecoms, where I became very interested in how the applications were made and how they worked.
I became enamoured by the technology industry, and my interest in building products flourished throughout my time there.

I would love to use my newly found skills after [Makers Academy](http://www.makersacademy.com/) and the [Natural History Museum](http://www.nhm.ac.uk/) to explore and build innovative products and applications, as well constantly evolving and learning as a programmer by challenging me to resolve new issues.

## Skills

#### Learning

Whether it has been in an academic sense or learning a new activity I have always enjoyed increasing my knowledge and skills. In my role as a brand ambassador I would research and study the material I was given and have to know everything about the product or service I was promoting in a short space of time.  
In my latest role in the museum I was put on a project to build a fully functioning chatbot within my first 3 months of the role, where I had to learn new technologies that no other developer had previously had experience in within a short space of time.

#### Working in a team

I enjoy working towards goals with a group of people.  One of the reasons I decided to learn code from Makers Academy was because I thought I would really enjoy the pair programming aspect of learning.  In Final Projects, we efficiently pair programmed and were able to produce an MVP in 3 days using React Native, which none of us had used before.

#### Inquisitive

I am constantly asking questions and passionate in understanding the details in a certain situation, whether that be how the body copes at high altitudes; such as in my thesis project, or why a particular piece of code works or not.

#### Time-keeping

During my time at Broadsoft I had to visit many partner offices to help in deployment of our product and training the vendors and sales people. My team was cut in half a few months into this project and I was soon faced with many more partners and very little time to travel around them all.

I therefore had to make sure everyone felt supported by doing many workshops remotely and dedicating specific time in the week to have question and answer sessions with all the partners.

#### Languages
Fluent English and Spanish, moderate German and a little Greek.
